Askaryan Frequency Content
==========================

In this example we explore how the freqeuncy spectrum of an Askaryan pulse changes as a function of the off-cone angle (i.e. the angular distance between the Cherenkov angle and the observation angle). This code can be run from the Frequency Content notebook in the examples directory.

    # Chereknov angle and plot its frequency spectrum.

    # You may notice the sharp cutoff in the frequency spectrum above 1 GHz.
    # This is due to the ice model, which defines the attenuation length in a
    # piecewise manner for frequencies above or below 1 GHz.
