====================

.. currentmodule:: pyrex

.. autoclass:: ListGenerator

   

   .. HACK -- the point here is that we don't want this to appear in the output, but the autosummary should still generate the pages.
      .. autosummary::
         :toctree:
      
         ListGenerator.create_event
